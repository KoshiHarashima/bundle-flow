  abstract = "Designing an incentive compatible auction that maximizes expected
              revenue is an intricate task. The single-item case was resolved in
              a seminal piece of work by Myerson in 1981. Even after 30--40
              years of intense research, the problem remains unsolved for
              settings with two or more items. We overview recent research
              results that show how tools from deep learning are shaping up to
              become a powerful tool for the automated design of near-optimal
              auctions auctions. In this approach, an auction is modeled as a
              multilayer neural network, with optimal auction design framed as a
              constrained learning problem that can be addressed with standard
              machine learning pipelines. Through this approach, it is possible
              to recover to a high degree of accuracy essentially all known
              analytically derived solutions for multi-item settings and obtain
              novel mechanisms for settings in which the optimal mechanism is
              unknown.",

                   multiple items has been a prominent and notoriously difficult
                   open problem. Existing work has mainly focused on deriving
                   analytical results tailored to a particular class of problems
                   (for example, Giannakopoulos (2015) and Yang (2023)). The
                   present paper explores the possibility of a generally
                   applicable methodology of the Automated Mechanism Design
                   (AMD). We first employ the deep learning algorithm developed
                   by Dütting et al. (2023) to numerically solve small-sized
                   problems, and the results are then generalized by educated
                   guesswork and finally rigorously verified through duality. By
                   focusing on a single buyer who can consume one item, our
                   approach leads to two key contributions: establishing a much
                   simpler way to verify the optimality of a wide range of
                   problems and discovering a completely new result about the
                   optimality of grand bundling. First, we show that selling
                   each item at an identical price (or equivalently, selling the
                   grand bundle of all items) is optimal for any number of items
                   when the value distributions belong to a class that includes
                   the uniform distribution as a special case. Different items
                   are allowed to have different distributions. Second, for each
                   number of items, we established necessary and sufficient
                   conditions that $c$ must satisfy for grand bundling to be
                   optimal when the value distribution is uniform over an
                   interval $[c, c + 1]$. This latter model does not satisfy the
                   previously known sufficient conditions for the optimality of
                   grand bundling Haghpanah and Hartline (2021). Our results are
                   in contrast to the only known results for $n$ items (for any
                   $n$), Giannakopoulos (2015) and Daskalakis et al. (2017),
                   which consider a single buyer with additive preferences,
                   where the values of items are narrowly restricted to i.i.d.
                   according to a uniform or exponential distribution.",

               smaller bundles compared to the grand bundle. Conversely, pure
               bundling is not optimal if consumers with higher values for the
               grand bundle have lower relative values. We prove the results by
