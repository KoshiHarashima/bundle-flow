  abstract      = "Categorical variables are a natural choice for representing
                   discrete structure in the world. However, stochastic neural
                   networks rarely use categorical latent variables due to the
                   inability to backpropagate through samples. In this work, we
                   present an efficient gradient estimator that replaces the
                   non-differentiable sample from a categorical distribution
                   with a differentiable sample from a novel Gumbel-Softmax
                   distribution. This distribution has the essential property
                   that it can be smoothly annealed into a categorical
                   distribution. We show that our Gumbel-Softmax estimator
                   outperforms state-of-the-art gradient estimators on
                   structured output prediction and unsupervised generative
                   modeling tasks with categorical latent variables, and enables
                   large speedups on semi-supervised classification.",

  abstract      = "Automated mechanism design (AMD) uses computational methods
                   for mechanism design. Differentiable economics is a form of
                   AMD that uses deep learning to learn mechanism designs and
                   has enabled strong progress in AMD in recent years.
                   Nevertheless, a major open problem has been to learn
                   multi-bidder, general, and fully strategy-proof (SP)
                   auctions. We introduce GEneral Menu-based NETwork (GemNet),
                   which significantly extends the menu-based approach of the
                   single-bidder RochetNet (Dütting et al., 2024) to the
                   multi-bidder setting. The challenge in achieving SP is to
                   learn bidder-independent menus that are feasible, so that the
                   optimal menu choices for each bidder do not over-allocate
                   items when taken together (we call this menu compatibility).
                   GemNet penalizes the failure of menu compatibility during
                   training, and transforms learned menus after training through
                   price changes, by considering a set of discretized bidder
                   values and reasoning about Lipschitz smoothness to guarantee
                   menu compatibility on the entire value space. This approach
                   is general, leaving trained menus that already satisfy menu
                   compatibility undisturbed and reducing to RochetNet for a
                   single bidder. Mixed-integer linear programs are used for
                   menu transforms, and through a number of optimizations
                   enabled by deep learning, including adaptive grids and
                   methods to skip menu elements, we scale to large auction
                   design problems. GemNet learns auctions with better revenue
                   than affine maximization methods, achieves exact SP whereas
                   previous general multi-bidder methods are approximately SP,
                   and offers greatly enhanced interpretability.",

                   sufficient condition under which the monopolist's problem is
                   equivalent to finding the upper envelope of the marginal
                   revenue curves. This approach guarantees that the optimal
                   mechanism is deterministic and can be implemented via a menu
                   of bundles. I further characterize this upper envelope using
                   a dominance notion. This characterization yields a

  abstract      = "Differentiable economics -- the use of deep learning for
                   auction design -- has driven progress in the automated design
                   of multi-item auctions with additive or unit-demand
                   valuations. However, little progress has been made for
                   optimal combinatorial auctions (CAs), even for the single
                   bidder case, because we need to overcome the challenge of the
                   bundle space growing exponentially with the number of items.
                   For example, when learning a menu of allocation-price choices
                   for a bidder in a CA, each menu element needs to efficiently
                   and flexibly specify a probability distribution on bundles.
                   In this paper, we solve this problem in the single-bidder CA
                   setting by generating a bundle distribution through an
                   ordinary differential equation (ODE) applied to a tractable
                   initial distribution, drawing inspiration from generative
                   models, especially score-based diffusion models and
                   continuous normalizing flow. Our method, BundleFlow, uses
                   deep learning to find suitable ODE-based transforms of
                   initial distributions, one transform for each menu element,
                   so that the overall menu achieves high expected revenue. Our
                   method achieves 1.11$-$2.23$\times$ higher revenue compared
                   with automated mechanism design baselines on the
                   single-bidder version of CATS, a standard CA testbed, and
                   scales to problems with up to 150 items. Relative to a
                   baseline that also learns allocations in menu elements, our
                   method reduces the training iterations by 3.6$-$9.5$\times$
                   and cuts training time by about 80\% in settings with 50 and
                   100 items.",
